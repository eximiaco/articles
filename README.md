# EximiaCo's articles

Welcome to EximiaCo's articles repository. 

This repository is the place where all of EximiaCo's articles are born. Every content about business ([eximia.co](eximia.co)), technology ([eximiaco.tech](eximiaco.tech)) or Microsoft ([eximiaco.ms](eximiaco.ms)) that we publish in our websites appears first here.

**This is NOT a community project.** For information about permission to reproduce selections of the content, write to us at [contact@eximia.co](mailto:contact@eximia.co).

## Contributing

All new articles must be proposed as pull requests.

At the root of this repository, there is a directory, named proposals, specific to new articles.

In the proposed directory, there are three subdirectories, one for each site (`co` | `tech` | `ms`). Within each subdirectory, articles must be separated according to the language in which they are written (`pt` | `en` | `es`).

Every new article must be written in a markdown file, where the file name must be the title of the article, replacing spaces with underscores.

For example, an article entitled "Hello World!", In English, for [EximiaCo.Tech](eximiaco.tech), should be submitted at `proposals/tech/en/hello_world.md`.

Published articles are moved to a proper archive directory.
